# **Project: Multi-Service Delivery Management Platform**  

## **Context**  
A company wants to build a centralized delivery management platform for multiple services (restaurants, stores, pharmacies). The system should allow partner businesses to manage their orders, drivers to receive and process deliveries, and end customers to track their orders in real time.  

---

## **Project Goals**  
- **Order Management**: Real-time order processing.  
- **Delivery Assignment**: Automatic order assignment based on proximity and driver availability.  
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Live driver location tracking.  
- **Notifications**: Order status updates via notifications.  
- **Scalability**: The system must handle up to 1 million orders per day.  
- **High Availability**: SLA of 99.9%.  

---

## **Functional Requirements**  
- User, business, and driver registration and authentication.  
- Order creation and management.  
- Order tracking (statuses: preparing, in delivery, delivered).  
- Online payment.  
- Notifications (SMS, emails, push notifications).  

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**  
- Horizontal scalability.  
- Average latency < 300ms for critical operations.  
- Data security (GDPR compliance).  
- Fault-tolerant system.  

---

## **Suggested Architecture**  

### **Frontend**  
- React.js / Next.js for user interfaces.  

### **Backend**  
- Node.js with TypeScript (REST or GraphQL).  

### **Database**  
- PostgreSQL (transactions)  
- Redis (cache)  

### **Messaging Queue**  
- Kafka / RabbitMQ for event management.  

### **External Services**  
- Stripe (payments)  
- Twilio (SMS)  
- Firebase (push notifications)  

### **Deployment**  
- Kubernetes (multi-region)  
- Docker  
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions  

### **Monitoring**  
- Prometheus  
- Grafana  
- ELK Stack

## **Next Steps**  
1. **Describe the main use case** (order creation).  
2. **Define the detailed architecture**.  
3. **Create diagrams** (data flow, components, sequences).  
4. **Estimate workloads** (QPS, storage).  
5. **Present scalability, security, and reliability solutions**.
